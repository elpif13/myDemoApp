App.java contains a static method named search. It takes at least 4 parameters (at least two of them must be Integer[9] or ArrayList<Integer>). 

It converts integer numbers into characters in lists, creates two separate strings, and checks whether they are anagrams.

AppTest.java contains unit tests. These tests are provided by JUnit.
